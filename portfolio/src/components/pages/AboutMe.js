                        Welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Autumn Legere, I am based out of Orem, UT, and for the past 3 years I have been a stay-at-home mom.
                        I recently made the decision to branch out and make a place for myself in the world of web development. It has been an absolutely terrifying
                        transition, but one that has filled my life with the sense of challenge and personal growth that I have been searching for.
            </p>
